# Overview Tanipedia ðŸŒ±
This repository contains the final project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. Our project, Tanipedia, was developed by a team of six students and serves as a comprehensive application that combines an agricultural encyclopedia with an integrated e-commerce platform.
The project demonstrates our understanding and application of object-oriented programming concepts, particularly focusing on creating modular, reusable, and user-friendly components using JavaFX and Scene Builder. Additionally, it highlights the practical use of programming to address real-world needs in the agricultural domain, such as providing farmers with essential information and tools for accessing fertilizers and pesticides.
